## Motivating Questions

- Have movies gotten longer?
- Are the magic runtimes of 60 / 90 / 120 minutes more important today than in the past?
- How has the distribution of movie runtimes evolved over the years?

This is a quick analysis to answer these questions using public IMDb data. The output is an animated series of histograms showing movie runtimes by year.

## Running It

You'll need:

- Python
- `matplotlib`
- `ImageMagick`
- `curl`

Then run:

```sh
make
```

After a minute or so, you can watch `imdb-runtimes.gif`.
